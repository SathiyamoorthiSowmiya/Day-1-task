 Define HTTP:

 * HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
 * it is used in client-server communication.
 * By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 
 * There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

 Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 :

 HTTP/1.1:

 * Html page before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server. 
 * Again you make a request to the server for image img.jpg and the server gives a response as an image img.jpg. 
 * The connection was not lost here after the first request because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client. 
 * There is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged in a single connection. 
 

 HTTP/2:

 * HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. 
 * HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format. 
 * It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. 
 * HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. 
 * It compresses the header. 
 * The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.

 Advantages:

 * HTTP/1.x uses formats like gzip to compress the data transferred in the messages.
 * HTTP/1.1 uses a TCP connection, each connection demands an individual flow control mechanism.
 * HTTP/2 supports full multiplexing for requests as well as responses over a single TCP connection. 
 Due to these capabilities, lower page load times are achieved by removing needless latency and improving the overall capacity of network alongside its availability.
 * All modern browsers support HTTP/2 over HTTPS with the SSL certificate installation. 
 To open HTTPS capable invisible proxy ports on every relevant port, OWASP ZAP or its alternatives could be used.

 Disadvantages:

 * While HTTP/2 mitigated the effects of HOL blocking in its predecessor, TCP-level block still causes problems.
 * client machines operating on a slow network, data packets drop bit by bit, and the network quality gets degraded to a single HTTP/2 connection. 
 * HTTP, which can affect the speed and performance of your website.
