Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

* Objects are important data types in javascript. 
* Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
* Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
* These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
* Every object has some property associated with some value.
* These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'Suzuki';

myCar.model = 'Altros';

myCar.year = 1978;

myCar.wheels = 2;

* The syntax for adding a property to an object is :

ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

* The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:

delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

* The syntax to access a property from an object is:

1.objectName.property        
           
2.objectName["property”]     
           
3.objectName[expression]

Object methods:

* An object method is an object property containing a function definition. 

 syntax:function(){return ignition.on}

* Create Object Literal: 

 way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below.

 let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

* Create Object with Constructor: 

 function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);  
console.log(car2.name); 

* Creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”;
